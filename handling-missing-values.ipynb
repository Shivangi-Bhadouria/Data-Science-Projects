In the next step, we're going to take a closer look at some of the columns with missing values and try to figure out what might be going on with them.\n\n# Figure out why the data is missing\n \nThis is the point at which we get into the part of data science that I like to call \"data intution\", by which I mean \"really looking at your data and trying to figure out why it is the way it is and how that will affect your analysis\". It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don't have a lot of experience. For dealing with missing values, you'll need to use your intution to figure out why the value is missing. One of the most important questions you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:\n\n> **Is this value missing because it wasn't recorded or because it doesn't exist?**\n\nIf a value is missing becuase it doesn't exist (like the height of the oldest child of someone who doesn't have any children) then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. These values you probably do want to keep as `NaN`. On the other hand, if a value is missing because it wasn't recorded, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row. This is called **imputation**, and we'll learn how to do it next! :)\n\nLet's work through an example. Looking at the number of missing values in the `nfl_data` dataframe, I notice that the column \"TimesSec\" has a lot of missing values in it: ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# look at the # of missing points in the first ten columns\nmissing_values_count[0:10]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-18T07:26:24.784473Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-18T07:26:24.785004Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-18T07:26:24.784744Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-18T07:26:24.784769Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By looking at [the documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016), I can see that this column has information on the number of seconds left in the game when the play was made. This means that these values are probably missing because they were not recorded, rather than because they don't exist. So, it would make sense for us to try and guess what they should be rather than just leaving them as NA's.\n\nOn the other hand, there are other fields, like \"PenalizedTeam\" that also have lot of missing fields. In this case, though, the field is missing because if there was no penalty then it doesn't make sense to say *which* team was penalized. For this column, it would make more sense to either leave it empty or to add a third value like \"neither\" and use that to replace the NA's.\n\n> **Tip:** This is a great place to read over the dataset documentation if you haven't already! If you're working with a dataset that you've gotten from another person, you can also try reaching out to them to get more information.\n\nIf you're doing very careful data analysis, this is the point at which you'd look at each column individually to figure out the best strategy for filling those missing values. For the rest of this notebook, we'll cover some \"quick and dirty\" techniques that can help you with missing values but will probably also end up removing some useful information or adding some noise to your data.\n\n# Drop missing values\n\nIf you're in a hurry or don't have a reason to figure out why your values are missing, one option you have is to just remove any rows or columns that contain missing values. (Note: I don't generally recommend this approch for important projects! It's usually worth it to take the time to go through your data and really look at all the columns with missing values one-by-one to really get to know your dataset.)  \n\nIf you're sure you want to drop rows with missing values, pandas does have a handy function, `dropna()` to help you do this.
